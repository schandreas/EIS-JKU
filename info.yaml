# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      When nCS is pulled low, each clock pulse on SCLK shifts a bit from MOSI into an internal register.
      The internal register length is 240 bits long (10 LEDs with 3 colors and 8 bit per color).
      The contents of this register are then used to generate output pulses. 
      The output pulses encode bits of the color data. They are 1.25us in length. A pulse representing a 1 
      has a high-time of 800ns and an low-time of 450ns. A pulse representing a 0 has a high-time of 400ns 
      and a low-time of 850ns. 
      Each LED consumes 24 bits. Subsequent bits are transmitted to LEDs further on the chain.
      When a full transmission (Every LED has received its 24 bits of color data) has occured, a reset occurs 
      (output goes low for >= 50 us).
      

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    Connect the LED_DATA pin to the DIN pin of a string of WS2812B LEDs. Use a microcontroller to shift in 
    color data via the SPI Interface.
